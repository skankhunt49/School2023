Competition

Definition
Active demand by two or more organisms or kinds of organisms for some environmental resource in short supply

Explanation 
Competition is the act of contesting other organisms for scarce resources

Examples
Green Anole and Brown Anole - when brown anole was introduced to Florida it caused competition on the ground floor of the forests for prey,
causing the green anole to move upwards interrupting other anoles feeding
Small Siphonaria lessoni and the Larger Fissurella crassa - used to compete for space in crevices but eventually the larger of the two species
the Fissurella crassa out-competed the Siphonaria lessoni moving it out into less hospitable space
Barnacles - barnacles compete for space so they can feed better
