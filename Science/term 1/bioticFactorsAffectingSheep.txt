Biotic Factors Affecting Domestic Sheep

In this system the biotic factors would include available food (in this case producer organisms such
as grass or wheat); other animals which might be competitors or consumers of the food (such as
kangaroos); decomposing organisms (such as dung beetles), which live on the sheep droppings;
and parasites or disease organisms (such as ticks and liver flukes), which live on or in the sheep.

One very important factor
primary producers need to
consider is whether their
pastures are productive and
healthy.
A number of biotic
interactions are important in
agricultural ecosystems that
involve symbiotic
relationships. Pasture
legumes form a symbiotic
(mutually beneficial)
association with specific soil
bacteria (rhizobia) to meet
their nitrogen requirements.
Nodules develop on the
plant roots and house millions of rhizobia bacteria that convert nitrogen from the air into a form the
plant can use in a process known as nitrogen fixation.
