                                      The Sign Said Not To
The sign said I shouldn't do it. It's not like I wasn't warned. But I still did it. I don't know if I regret it. Sometimes I do. 

Let's go in there I said. But my friends didn't want to. The sign says not to go in they all said. But I wanted to go in. Some of them chickened
out but it didn't stop the rest of us. We all went in.

It was dark in there. We couldn't see much. We saw an abandoned minecart. "I wonder why they abandoned the mine" I wondered. We kept going in.
I felt a cold breeze go down my neck. As I took another step forward some rock fell and I heard a splash. "Stop" I whispered, worried that the 
cave would collapse if I spoke any louder.

I was worried. "We should go back" I heard. Everyone agreed.

As we where walking back we heard more rocks fall. We became worried. We started running.

We heard more rocks fall. It was getting louder. It was getting closer. We could see the end. I was at the end of our group as I had been leading
before. As everyone was exiting the rocks where closing in on me. 

Just as I got out I saw the mine completely cave in. It was silently agreed we would never talk about this again.

I still think about that mine. I don't wonder why it was closed down anymore. I wonder more about it though. What was mined?. Why did it become
so unstable? Maybe one day I'll go back and finally find closure.
