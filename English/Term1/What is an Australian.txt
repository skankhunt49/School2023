What is an Australian? This is a complex question which to a lot of people has been brought to the top of many peoples minds with the
recent voice referendum discussion. To many what it means to be Australian is to be a white anglo saxon male who drinks a metric f**k ton
of alcohol. But Australia as a large multicultural country has many different cultures and subcultures within it. One of these said subcultures
is the so called bogan subculture. This group of white predominantly male people spend huge amounts of time drinking and doing other stupid
things. The large majority of these people are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and grew up with christian or catholic baby boomer
parents. This is just one example of the rich subcultures of the Australian people. 

Another increasingly common perspective on this matter is what an Australian is relative to the first nations people of  our country. 
To many first nations people all other people within the country are just invaders or immigrants. This is from an empirical perspective
completely true. Australia is a nation of immigrants with an increasingly small population of first nations people. This of course raises a 
debate for many people. If they make up such a small portion of our population then why should we accommodate for these people especially many 
people will say. These people will provide this as an argument against things such as the voice referendum. This is of course a terrible argument
which can be very quickly and easily debunked. Study after study shows that first nations people despite making up an increasingly small portion
of our population make up larger and larger proportions of our prison populations or the number of people who die in custody. They also make up 
larger and larger groups of people with crime or alcohol problems. This is something that needs to be addressed as it has traceable roots in 
the actions of us as immigrants to this country. The established system in this country has caused all of this since the founding of our country
as a European style state. This means that it is crucially important we address this stuff at the highest level of government to try and undo some
of the incredible damage we have caused. Apart from this we must also consider the culture of the colonizers. 

These people have shaped the country to the one we know to day and are currently the dominant culture within Australia. This culture is that of
the white anglo saxon background. Predominantly
