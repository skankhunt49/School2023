What is an Australian? This is a complex question which to a lot of people has been brought to the top of many peoples minds with the
recent voice referendum discussion. To many what it means to be Australian is to be a white anglo saxon male who drinks a metric f**k ton
of alcohol. But Australia as a large multicultural country has many different cultures and subcultures within it. One of these said subcultures
is the so called bogan subculture. This group of white predominantly male people spend huge amounts of time drinking and doing other stupid
things. The large majority of these people are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and grew up with christian or catholic baby boomer
parents. This is just one example of the rich subcultures of the Australian people. 

Another increasingly common perspective on this matter is what an Australian is relative to the first nations people of  our country.
