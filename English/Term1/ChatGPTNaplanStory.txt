                                              The Sign Says Broken Dreams
Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The village was known for its lush greenery, friendly people,
 and an old, weathered sign that stood at the entrance of the village.

This sign was unlike any other sign in the world. It was made of old, rough wood, and was painted with fading letters that read "Welcome to the
Village of Happy Thoughts." Despite its rough appearance, the sign held a special magic that drew people from far and wide to the village.

One day, a young girl named Lily was passing through the village on her way to visit her grandmother. As she approached the sign, she noticed
that something was different. The sign no longer read "Welcome to the Village of Happy Thoughts." Instead, it now read "Welcome to the Village 
of Broken Dreams."

Lily was puzzled. She had always heard that the village was a place of happiness and joy. Why would the sign now say something so sad and
negative? She decided to ask the villagers what was going on.

As she made her way through the village, she noticed that the once-bustling streets were now empty and quiet. The houses were still and the
gardens were overgrown. The villagers she spoke to told her that the change in the sign had brought a dark cloud over the village, and that the
villagers were now filled with sadness and despair.

Lily was determined to help. She knew that the sign was magical, and she believed that if she could change the words on the sign, she could
change the villagers' happiness. She decided to take matters into her own hands and set out to repaint the sign.

With the help of her grandmother and the other villagers, Lily repainted the sign with bright, bold letters that read "Welcome to the Village of
Happy Thoughts." As soon as the final stroke of paint was applied, a bright light filled the sky and the sun shone down on the village.

The villagers were amazed as they felt a warmth in their hearts and a sense of happiness they had not felt in a long time. The flowers in the
gardens bloomed, the birds sang, and the children played in the streets once again. The village had been brought back to life, all because of
the magic of the sign and the bravery of Lily.

From that day forward, the village of Happy Thoughts was a place of joy and happiness once again, and the sign at the entrance of the village
continued to shine brightly and bring happiness to all who passed by.
