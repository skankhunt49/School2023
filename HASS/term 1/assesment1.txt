quotes "The life of modern industry becomes a series of periods of moderate activity, 
prosperity, over-production, crisis and stagnation. The uncertainty and instability to which 
machinery subjects the employment, and consequently the conditions of existence, of the 
operatives become normal, owing to these periodic changes of the industrial cycle."- Marx Karl, 1867, page 300, paragraph 1

cheapening commodities."- Marx Karl, 1867, page 300, paragraph 1

Marx's work covers many issues in the industrial revolution providing a very sound source of information on the effect of work on society at the
time. In section 7 we see Marx discuss the factory and how it affected people at the time. This information has been greatly utilized in my text.
