prosperity, over-production, crisis and stagnation. The uncertainty and instability to which 
machinery subjects the employment, and consequently the conditions of existence, of the 
operatives become normal, owing to these periodic changes of the industrial cycle."- Marx Karl, 1867, page 300, paragraph 1
