quotes "The life of modern industry becomes a series of periods of moderate activity, 
prosperity, over-production, crisis and stagnation. The uncertainty and instability to which 
machinery subjects the employment, and consequently the conditions of existence, of the 
operatives become normal, owing to these periodic changes of the industrial cycle."- Marx Karl, 1867, page 300, paragraph 1

Marx's work covers many issues in the industrial revolution providing a very sound source of information on the effect of work on society at the
time. In section 7 we see Marx discuss the factory and how it affected people at the time. This information has been greatly utilized in my text.

quotes
"“A steadily increasing proportion of capital in industry,” writes Hilferding, “ceases to 
belong to the industrialists who employ it. They obtain the use of it only through the 
medium of the banks which, in relation to them, represent the owners of the capital. On 
the other hand, the bank is forced to sink an increasing share of its funds in industry. 
Thus, to an ever greater degree the banker is being transformed into an industrial 
capitalist. This bank capital, i.e., capital in money form, which is thus actually 
transformed into industrial capital, I call ‘finance capital’.” “Finance capital is capital 
controlled by banks and employed by industrialists.”"-Vladmir Ilyich Lenin, 1916, page 33 ,paragraph 1

Lenin writes about the way banks influenced the lives of owner class in this new societal order. This gives us a unique insight into the way in 
which that new societal order was changing from the old order of feudalism.
