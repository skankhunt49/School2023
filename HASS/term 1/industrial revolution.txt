Population Growth and Movements

pre 1700 growth was slow or negative
post 1700 5 million approached 9 million in 100 years due to
  medical advance
  more people having babies
  those people having more babies
  more babies surviving to adulthood

improvements in agricultural knowledge and farming methods reduced farm labours
this caused people to move to towns and cities
not enough work caused people to turn to crime
this caused an overflow of prisons and sending of convicts to Australia and America

during the 1800s millions migrated to Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand
Irish and Scottish Potato Famines cause huge immigration and starvation

enclosed farming  
  effect on landowners 
    extremely profitable
  effect on peasants
    caused many to drop to poverty and starve
    often had to move for better employment prospects

Jethro tull
seed drill
  effect on seed loss
    seed loss minimized
  effect on crop yields
    drastically increased

due to all these factors the rich begin exporting food while the people of their country starve due to higher profit
machination of textile production allows rich to pay less and reduce the amount of people required to produce sending more to poverty
soon buildings are too large and now factorized eliminating even more ability to not work for a wage and increasing alienation of workers
this causes people to flock to cities causing huge shortages of everything
the watt steam engine causes even more automation and alienation
factories are solidified
new engines make trains incredibly useful for human transport as well

British Empire
produce from other countries is stolen by British to fuel them
beginning of modern intellectual property landowners
British shipping is engraved in law to prevent foreign shipping
British navy is used for colonization and trade protection

The Cotton Industry

wool used up until the beginning of industrial revolution
this was due to cotton not being easy to grow in England
wool is used to earn peasants extra money

after American plantations became larger this became less and less common
American plantations provide cotton and automation removes a lot of the labour of peasants
also alienates the worker from the products of their labour and forces them into wage labour
in 1750s it takes 1000 hours to spin a kg of cotton in 1990s it takes 6 hours

Age of Coal And improvements
Demands for coal and iron increased drastically during 18th and 19th century
chimneys being added to houses made it usable for heating driving up D
