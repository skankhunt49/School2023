seed drill
  effect on seed loss
    seed loss minimized
  effect on crop yields
    drastically increased

due to all these factors the rich begin exporting food while the people of their country starve due to higher profit
machination of textile production allows rich to pay less and reduce the amount of people required to produce sending more to poverty
soon buildings are too large and now factorized eliminating even more ability to not work for a wage and increasing alienation of workers
this causes people to flock to cities causing huge shortages of everything
the watt steam engine causes even more automation and alienation
factories are solidified
new engines make trains incredibly useful for human transport as well
